    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
     The vision of the 10/10 Alumni Award and Leadership Summit is to support
     and promote world class visionary leadership that impacts India and the
     world. It also aims to make visionary leadership thinking a part of culture
     and society.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
     One of the ways to fulfil this vision is instituting the 10 on 10 list. The
     intent of the list is two-fold â€“ firstly, to recognize and encourage
     visionary leaders early so they may scale greater heights, and secondly, to
     create role models who inspire youth inculcate leadership thinking.

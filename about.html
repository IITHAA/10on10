     The 10/10 Alumni Summit is a biannual event that seeks to promote and
     provide a platform for IITH alumni to showcase their visionary leadership
     potential and connects them with mentors, investors, alumni, and
     like-minded people. 10 most influential alumni who have done outstanding
     work in the past 10 years would be selected through nominations (self/peer)
     and a selection process. A jury of distinguished leaders from various
     domains from India and abroad examine the nomineeâ€™s achievements of the
     nominees against various metrics, placing the winners on par with the
     finest visionaries in the world. To celebrate this, we will have a 2-day
     event at the end of December that includes a networking dinner with
     prominent leaders, an official magazine, and a press release. To celebrate
     this, we will have a Visionary Leadership Summit with an official magazine
     and press release.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
     For decades, IITs have been the heart of innovation for decades and have
     produced some of the world's most influential leaders like Sunder Pichai
     (Google CEO), Parag Agrawal (Twitter CEO), Arvind Agrawal (Delhi CM,
     founder AAP) and Raghuram Rajan (ex RBI Governor), among others. The 10/10
     Summit is a first-of-its-kind initiative to honor the IITH alumni who have
     the potential to become the next world-changing leader, be in academia,
     entrepreneurship, administration, or society at large.
